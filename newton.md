# Preface
Have you ever wondered how the Higgs boson gives mass to particle only for the explanation to go something like this:
> At around 10<sup>15</sup>K, the Higgs field gains a VEV, causing the mixing of weak hypercharge and weak isospin fields, which causes it to lose 3 of its 4 degrees of freedom, giving mass to the W and Z bosons. Also it's only responsible for like 1% of your mass lmao.

Well I have and for every new question I followed it to an answer until there was no more confusion. In this series of markdown files of questionable quality, I invite you on a trip through time, where nothing will be handed as an absolute truth to accept, but rather every possible explanation will be followed and proven right or wrong, until the only logical answer is the Higgs boson.

# Stuff that will be handed as absolute truth to accept
Yeah, there are some prerequisites, otherwise we'd have to go all the way back to Ancient Greece.

## Newton's 1<sup>st</sup> law of motion
> Every object perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon.

Basically this:

$F=0 \implies \dfrac{dv}{dt}=0$

## Newton's 2<sup>nd</sup> law of motion
>The change of motion of an object is proportional to the force impressed; and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed.

Basically this (Newton called momentum "motion"):

$F=\dfrac{dp}{dt}$

## Newton's 3<sup>rd</sup> law of motion
>To every action, there is always opposed an equal reaction; or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.

Which can be developed into a more encompassing:

$\sum\dfrac{dp_i}{dt} = 0$

Where $p_i$ is the momentum of a body in a closed system, and the sum includes all the bodies of the system.

## Calculus
Yeah, that's also a thing you have to know. It's too long to explain everything, but maybe I'll do one where we discover the Lebesgue measure of a ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$ starting from addition and natural numbers.
